# Lab #8 Assignment: Independent Project

## Overview

You will choose an independent project to extend one of the exercises you
did in a previous lab (#2--#6). You will work alone or with a partner
to develop a new question that goes beyond the previous lab assignments, but
builds upon a previous exercise. 

After finishing your investigation, over the next several weeks, 
You will turn in a formal lab report, prepared with 
RMarkdown and knitted successfully into a PDF file by 5:00 pm on 
Friday April 8.
The length of the formal report should be comparable to what you have turned in
for previous labs.
Because this is an independent project, rather than something with detailed 
instructions, you have several weeks to investigate your topic.

This project repository contains copies of the scripts we used in previous labs
and a blank RMarkdown file in which you can fill in your lab report.
