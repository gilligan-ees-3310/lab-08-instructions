# Introduction

You have done several structured labs that provided opportunities to learn 
about R, RMarkdown, and several different aspects of climate science (data 
analysis and several computer models).  
For the next few weeks, you will have a chance to utilize the skills you have 
learned thus far in lab to take one of the previous labs you have worked on 
and dig more deeply into the details, and develop it into a formal report about 
a particular aspect of climate change. 
This series of labs consists of creating a detailed written lab report in 
RMarkdown. 

For this project, you will choose a lab you worked on before and explore
it more deeply, doing some library research on the topic and connecting 
that with your computational analysis. Your analysis should begin with the 
work you did for the original lab, but dig into the details of how you draw
conclusions from the data you analyzed.

## Solo or Team Projects

You may choose to do this project individually or with a partner as a team 
effort. If you work with a partner, you may work together to design the 
question, obtain and analyze data, and write a report together. 
We expect teams to include a note in the report that indicates which
member contributed what to the report (this does not need to be super detailed
and can say, "Alice and Bob designed the experiment together. Bob wrote the
code to run the models. Alice wrote the code for the data analysis. 
Alice and Bob contributed equally to writing the discussion and conclusions.")
This is similar to the requirement at many research journals that 
co-authored papers include a statement of what each author contributed.

## Choosing a Topic

For undergraduates, we recommend that you choose a topic from one of the 
exercises that you did in labs #2--6 and think of a way to go a little more 
deeply into the topic of the questions that exercise asked. What I am looking
for is not for you to investigate a brand new question or research topic, 
but for you to focus on the details of the exertise you did and think about 
how to present it to the reader, explaining in clear prose how you used data
to answer a question about the climate.

For graduate students, we expect you to try something more ambitious than just 
simple extensions of the questions from the lab exercises, but it is still fine 
to take one of the lab exercises as a starting point.

If you want to do something really different than what we have done previously 
in lab, that is fine. But check with one of us to make sure your plan is 
appropriate and feasible (we don't want you to bite off more than you can chew).
Just writing up the details on one of the lab exercises should be plenty of 
work.

**Be creative!** Now is the time to really explore parts of the class that you 
have found interesting and present your findings in a unique, exciting way. 

# Writen Report (Due `r date_fmt(due_date)`)

Your report should be comprehensive, yet not overly verbose. One recommendation 
for achieving this is to create an outline to organize your thoughts before 
initializing writing and data analysis. The report needs to include the 
following components:

* Introduction

  * _Provide background information that frames the problem you are 
    addressing (e.g., an exercise from one of the previous labe). 
    At the end of the introduction, the reader should understand 
    exactly **what the problem is** that you are addressing and why that 
    problem is **interesting** and **relevant** to the climate system._
    
* Methods

  * _Describe the methods for answering your question. The methods section 
    should be written such that someone who doesn't know about your 
    project could follow your steps and recreate your results._

  * This section should contain the R code you use to do the analysis:
  
    * Identifying the sources of data: what data did you use (observations,
      model output, etc.), and why is that data useful for addressing your
      research problem.

    + How did you get your data into R? Did you download from the internet, 
      read it in from files on your computer, run models, etc.

    + How did you process your data to clean it up? Describe what your
      R code did to manipulate the data to make it easier to analyze. 
      Think of how you used functions like `mutate`, `gather`, 
      `summarize`, etc. to convert the data into a useful form.

    + How did you analyze data? What did you do to analyze the data, such 
      as generating descriptive statistics like the mean or standard 
      deviation, fitting linear models to get slopes (rates of change), etc.
        
  * The R code does not speak for itself, so describe what you did in words.
    Don't tell the reader every little detail, but present a clear overview 
    of the big picture of how you obtained, cleaned, and analyzed your data.
    If there were particular challenges or difficulties, briefly describe 
    them.

* Results

  * _Describe the results of your analyses. Include apropriate charts, 
    tables, graphs, and other quantitative representations of data._ 

  * This section should have R code for making graphs, tables, etc.

* Conclusions/Discussion

  * _Discuss how you drew conclusions from your analysis._
  
    * What conclusions can you draw from your results about the research 
      question or questions?

    * How does the data (and your analysis of it) support those conclusions?

* Works Cited

  * _Include a works cited section to credit the research and thoughts that 
    are not your own. Be sure to use citations throughout your report where 
    necessary._

  * I will post a separate document that explains how to do citations and 
    bibliographies in RMarkdown.

Final reports are to be pushed to your Lab 8 Github repository 
_no later than `r time_fmt(due_date)` on `r date_fmt(due_date)`_. 
**You must push the .Rmd file *and* the knitted PDF** to Github. 
A portion of your final report grade will reflect effective use of 
R/RMarkdown/Github, the clarity and succinctness of your writing, 
visual representations of data, appropriate discussion of results, 
and insights into future analyses.
